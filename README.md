# Vehicle Fleet Analysis in Lombardy

## Project Overview

This repository contains a **Data Science project** that analyzes the vehicle fleet in the Lombardy region (Italy). The focus is on analyzing various aspects such as:

- Vehicle types
- Age distribution of vehicles
- Emission levels
- Trends over time

The primary goal is to uncover insights and patterns from public datasets using modern data analysis techniques.


## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing data and standardizing vehicle information.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Detailed visualizations to explore vehicle distribution, fuel types, and emission statistics.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Predictive models for fleet growth, emission trends, and vehicle clustering by characteristics.
- **Reports and Insights:** Generation of visual reports summarizing key trends and data-driven insights.
